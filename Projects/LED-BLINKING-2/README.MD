# Project 02 ( Led Blinking 2 )
[Live-In-Production Demo](https://wokwi.com/projects/363508918601001985)_________________________________________ _Individual Project | Duration: 20 Minutes_ <br>
- This is a basic Led Blinking Project using Arduino.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Tech Stack
Tech : `Arduino Programming` `Hardware` <br>

Tools : `Arduino IDE`

## üìù I Learn
- Programming fundamentals: You will learn how to write and upload code to an Arduino board, and how to control the behavior of multiple LEDs.

- Electronics basics: You will learn how to connect and control multiple LEDs using an Arduino board, and how to use resistors to limit the current flowing through the LEDs.

- Problem-solving: You will learn how to identify and fix common problems that can occur when working with electronics and programming.

- Time management: You will develop planning and organization skills as you work through the project, managing your time and resources to meet your goals.

- Teamwork (if applicable): If you work on this project with others, you will learn how to collaborate effectively, communicate ideas, and divide responsibilities to complete the project successfully.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Working
1. Gather the necessary components, including 5 to 6 LEDs, resistors, breadboard, jumper wires, and an Arduino board.

2. Connect the positive leg of each LED to a digital pin of the Arduino board, and connect the negative leg of each LED to a common ground.

3. Insert a resistor in series with each LED to limit the current flowing through it.

4. Write a code in the Arduino IDE that will turn on all the digital pins connected to the LEDs, wait for a specified amount of time, and then turn them off.

5. Upload the code to the Arduino board using a USB cable.

6. The Arduino board will execute the code and turn on all the LEDs Simultaneously.

7. The code will then wait for a specified amount of time, turn off all the LEDs, and repeat the cycle.
