# Project 02 ( Led Blinking Using Push Button )
[Live-In-Production Demo]()_________________________________________ _Individual Project | Duration: 20 Minutes_ <br>
- This is a basic Led Blinking using push button Project using Arduino.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
Tech : `Arduino Programming` `Hardware` <br>

Tools : `Arduino IDE`

## 📝 I Learn
- How to connect electronic components to an Arduino board.
- How to write and upload code to an Arduino board.
- How to use digital input and output pins on an Arduino board.
- How to use a push button to control an LED.
- How to use conditional statements (if-else) in your code.


## ☑️ Working
1. Gather the necessary components, including 5 to 6 LEDs, resistors, breadboard, jumper wires, and an Arduino board.

2. Connect the positive leg of each LED to a digital pin of the Arduino board, and connect the negative leg of each LED to a common ground.

3. Insert a resistor in series with each LED to limit the current flowing through it.

4. Write a code in the Arduino IDE that will turn on all the digital pins connected to the LEDs, wait for a specified amount of time, and then turn them off.

5. Upload the code to the Arduino board using a USB cable.

6. The Arduino board will execute the code and turn on all the LEDs simultaneously.

7. The code will then wait for a specified amount of time, turn off all the LEDs, and repeat the cycle.
