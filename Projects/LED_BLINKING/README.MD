# Project 01 ( Led Blinking )
[Live-In-Production Demo](https://wokwi.com/projects/363461862718731265)_________________________________________ _Individual Project | Duration: 10 Minutes_ <br>
- This is a basic Led Blinking Project using Arduino.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
Tech : `Arduino Programming` `Hardware` <br>

Tools : `Arduino IDE`

## 📝 I Learn
- First Interfacing using Arduino.

## ☑️ Working
1. First, connect an LED to one of the digital pins of the Arduino board. Also, connect a resistor to the LED to limit the current flowing through it.

2. Write a code in the Arduino IDE that will turn the LED on for a certain amount of time and then turn it off for another specified amount of time.

3. Upload the code to the Arduino board using a USB cable.

4. The Arduino board will execute the code, and the digital pin connected to the LED will output either a high or a low signal depending on the code.

5. If the output signal is high, the LED will turn on, and if the output signal is low, the LED will turn off.

6. The code specifies how long the LED should stay on and how long it should stay off, and the Arduino board will repeat this cycle until the code is stopped or the      power is turned off.
